                    My name is Jyoti. My family roots are in Daltonganj, Jharkhand. However, I have lived in different states across India due to my father's defense background (Indian Army) and my diverse professional experiences, including Delhi (Delhi Cantonment, South Delhi), Uttar Pradesh (Mathura, Faizabad), Jammu & Kashmir (Uri), Gujarat (Ahmedabad & Kutch), Kerala (Kottayam & Trivandrum), Haryana (Sonipat  & Gurugram), Bihar (Gaya), Tamil Nadu (Auroville & Pondicherry). I have enjoyed learning about different Indian cultures & people from a young age. I was inclined to know more about Indian history, and its rich heritage from the beginning.

                    I studied history for my bachelor's degree at the University of Delhi. One of the most common responses I would get is- 'why do you like history? it's so boring'. These comments never bothered me. I enjoyed learning from the past and connecting what I learned in textbooks to the real world. As a result, I regularly volunteered at cultural organizations, museums as well as non-profits. These experiences were extremely valuable as they helped me practically interact with Indian history, learn about my cultural roots, and the chance to work with people from diverse backgrounds. One of the most memorable experiences has been my work with Pravah (youth leadership nonprofit); I got numerous incredible opportunities to learn from mentors, a diverse set of peers, and communities to understand myself better. I was also a recipient of an international yearlong exchange between Pravah and their partner organization- Misereor in Germany (2016-2017). Being in Germany, at such a young age, was transformational. It was an extremely challenging year for me. I worked with Caritas in Cologne and led education programs for children, adolescents, and adults as part of different projects. I also gained an opportunity to travel across Europe and explore cultural institutions, museums, and cities. I made friends across the world. The experience helped me understand my interests and further strengthened my love for Indian heritage and culture.

                    I studied Heritage Management at the Centre for Heritage Management, Ahmedabad University (2018-2020). The two years helped me explore the vast world of heritage and I studied Indian crafts, natural heritage, cultural heritage, and so much more. I got an opportunity to visit the Korea National University for Cultural Heritage (KNUCH), South Korea for a month and delve deeper into another Asian culture. As part of my academic thesis, I worked on connecting traditional crafts with the school curriculum. I have curated and conducted Heritage walks in Ahmedabad on various themes focusing on narratives about women, craftspeople, textiles, and historical stories. The year I completed my master's- covid hit the world and everything came to a standstill. My health was impacted and it took me a few months to recover. Around this time I started documenting my learnings and writing for UNESCO-ICHCAP. What started as an article about a craft started a journey of its own and I have been writing about Indian cultural heritage for the last 4 years.

                    I worked as a Chief Minister's Good Governance Associate (CMGGA) in Sonipat district, Haryana (2021-22), and worked on 15+ welfare programs. My interest in the culture space inspired me to initiate a project on basket weaving- a traditional craft practiced in the Sonipat region- to strengthen women's livelihood possibilities in the district. I enjoyed designing the project and engaging with rural women to revive an age-old craft from Haryana.

                    I worked with an early-stage start-up focusing on building and improving the quality of life by focusing on well-being based on ancient knowledge systems of India. I had the rare opportunity to meet, interact, and learn about the oldest systems written about well-being and understand the interconnections & relevance in the modern world. This was a life-changing experience and all the learning has helped me so much to improve my health and look at wellbeing from a completely different lens. I wish to document all my learnings from such diverse and rich experiences here and hope to grow as an individual by connecting with the right people, community & space for such knowledge.
